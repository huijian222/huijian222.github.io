I am Jinbang Lai (赖金榜), a third-year master's student in Computer Science at [China Three Gorges University](https://eng.ctgu.edu.cn/). I received my B.Eng. from [Hangzhou Normal University](https://english.hznu.edu.cn/) in 2020.



# :microscope: Research
My research interests lie at the intersection of deep reinforcement learning, large language models, and robotics. 
I am always eager to discuss innovative research ideas and explore potential academic collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email if you’re interested in working together.
